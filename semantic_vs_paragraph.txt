Comparison of Semantic vs Paragraph Chunking

Both chunking strategies achieved strong retrieval performance, but semantic chunking consistently outperformed paragraph-based chunking across all evaluation metrics. Semantic chunks align with the natural structure of resumes (skills, experience, projects, education), which creates cleaner and more meaningful embedding representations.

Paragraph-based chunking produced a larger number of smaller, less coherent chunks, slightly increasing noise in the vector space. This resulted in small but measurable reductions in Precision@10, MAP, and nDCG.

Overall, semantic chunking is the superior strategy for resume indexing within a RAG system, offering better ranking quality and higher relevance in top-k retrieval.

| Metric       | Semantic   | Paragraph | Winner                         |
| ------------ | ---------- | --------- | ------------------------------ |
| Precision@10 | 0.8550 | 0.8540    | Semantic                       |
| Recall@10    | 0.2246 | 0.2236    | Semantic                       |
| MAP          | 0.8535 | 0.8502    | Semantic                       |
| nDCG@10      | 0.8941 | 0.8938    | Semantic                       |
| Total Chunks | 4495   | 5183      | Semantic (fewer, more focused) |


Why Semantic Chunking Performs Better

Even though the difference seems small, it makes sense:

🧠 1. Semantic chunks = more meaningful units

the semantic chunker uses headings like:

SKILLS

EXPERIENCE

EDUCATION

PROJECTS

Meaning each chunk is self-contained and focused. Embeddings love that.

📄 2. Paragraph chunking = arbitrary splits

Paragraphs aren’t guaranteed to represent meaningful semantic units.
A paragraph might contain:

- half of a skill list

- mixed topics

- incomplete sentences

Vector similarity suffers slightly.

💡 3. Larger chunks in paragraph method dilute meaning

the paragraph chunking produced more chunks (5183) vs 4495 for semantic.
More chunks → more noise → slight drop in MAP and nDCG.
