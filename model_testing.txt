Has full‑stack projects demonstrating backend implementation (Ibrahim khdairCV .docx.pdf, chunk_id=1/3).
Other candidates with backend-relevant skills (not ranked above):

Toqa Asedah: built and integrated back-end APIs using FastAPI (ToqaAsedahCV.pdf, chunk_id=2).
Rama (cv_training.pdf): expresses interest in backend development and has related projects/skills (cv_training.pdf, chunk_id=0; chunk_id=1).
O. AbuReesh and Sama Shalabi list Node/Express, databases and auth work but show less explicit backend project/training detail compared with the top four (O.AbuReesh - CV.pdf, chunk_id=6; samaShalabiCV(fullstack).pdf, chunk_id=7).
Recommendation summary:

If you want a candidate with explicit REST framework experience and JWT/RBAC implemented, Adham Yaqoub is the top match (Adham Yaqoub - CV.docx.pdf, chunk_id=0).
If you prefer C#/ASP.NET Core backend experience plus JWT/RBAC, consider Emad Daraghmeh (Emad Daraghmeh CV.docx.pdf, chunk_id=1).
For Java EE / Struts / servlet experience, consider Mohammad Sayeh (Mohammad Sayeh resume.pdf, chunk_id=1).
For Node.js/Express/MongoDB backend work, consider Ibrahim Khdair (Ibrahim khdairCV(SW).pdf, chunk_id=3; chunk_id=2).
If you want, I can (a) filter candidates by a specific tech stack (Django, Node, Java, C#), or (b) produce interview questions tailored to the top candidate(s).

If you need a narrower recommendation (e.g., focus on big‑data pipelines vs. exploratory analysis and visualization), I can re-rank or select the best fit based on that criterion.

5. Comparison questions (harder but 🔥)
Q: Compare Candidate O. AbuReesh and Ibrahim Khdair in terms of technical skills.

A: Summary: O. AbuReesh’s resume emphasizes data science / machine‑learning and some web/backend work (Elasticsearch, Node/React, Mongo/SQL). Ibrahim Khdair’s resume lists a broader set of software engineering / full‑stack backend technologies and languages (Java, PHP, C#, multiple frameworks, SQL DBs) and common dev tools. Evidence below.

Tools / others: GitHub, Trello, Slack, Postman, Swagger, Figma, Docker (basic), design patterns & principles, Notion, Jira (Ibrahim khdairCV .docx.pdf, chunk_id=5; Ibrahim khdairCV(SW).pdf, chunk_id=4; Ibrahim khdairCV .docx.pdf, chunk_id=6).
Direct comparisons / overlap (both mention)

Python (O.AbuReesh - CV.pdf, chunk_id=6) and (Ibrahim khdairCV .docx.pdf, chunk_id=5).
JavaScript / frontend frameworks (React) and Node.js: O. AbuReesh lists React.js and Node.js (O.AbuReesh - CV.pdf, chunk_id=6); Ibrahim lists React and Node.js / Express (Ibrahim khdairCV .docx.pdf, chunk_id=5; Ibrahim khdairCV(SW).pdf, chunk_id=4).
Git / GitHub and general dev tooling: O. AbuReesh lists git & github (O.AbuReesh - CV.pdf, chunk_id=6); Ibrahim lists GitHub and many collaboration tools (Ibrahim khdairCV .docx.pdf, chunk_id=5).
Key differences

ML / IR focus: O. AbuReesh shows explicit ML / NLP work (word embeddings, RF, SVM), Elasticsearch-based document retrieval, and a Datacamp/data‑science internship (O.AbuReesh - CV.pdf, chunk_id=3; O.AbuReesh - CV.pdf, chunk_id=0; O.AbuReesh - CV.pdf, chunk_id=5).
Broad language & framework coverage: Ibrahim lists many additional languages (Java, TypeScript, C#, PHP) and backend/web frameworks (Laravel, ASP.NET Core, Django REST) and enterprise DBs (SQL Server, PostgreSQL) not shown for O. AbuReesh (Ibrahim khdairCV .docx.pdf, chunk_id=5; Ibrahim khdairCV(SW).pdf, chunk_id=4).
Databases: both list MongoDB and SQL variants, but Ibrahim explicitly lists multiple RDBMS (MySQL, SQL Server, PostgreSQL) (Ibrahim khdairCV .docx.pdf, chunk_id=5; O.AbuReesh - CV.pdf, chunk_id=6).
Short conclusion

If you need a candidate with machine‑learning / NLP and search/indexing experience: O. AbuReesh is better supported by the resume (Elasticsearch, embeddings, RF/SVM, Datacamp/data‑science internship) (O.AbuReesh - CV.pdf, chunk_id=0; chunk_id=3; chunk_id=5).
If you need broad full‑stack / backend engineering coverage across many languages, frameworks, and RDBMS tools: Ibrahim Khdair shows broader exposure (Java, PHP, C#, Laravel, ASP.NET Core, Django REST, MySQL/SQL Server/Postgres, Docker, Postman, Swagger) (Ibrahim khdairCV .docx.pdf, chunk_id=5; Ibrahim khdairCV(SW).pdf, chunk_id=4).
If you want, I can produce a one‑line shortlist recommendation for a specific role (ML engineer vs. Full‑stack/Backend) with the cited rationale.

Internship and certification: Data Science intern at DataCamp (Feb 2024–present) and completed the AI fundamental certificate with hands‑on projects (O.AbuReesh - CV.pdf, chunk_id=5).
Attention to detail and data handling: data entry / data collector role where they collected, filtered, and entered opportunities, implementing search‑best practices and maintaining accuracy under deadlines (O.AbuReesh - CV.pdf, chunk_id=5; chunk_id=6).
Teamwork and leadership: led/fostered team communication on projects and received recognition from a project supervisor for performance (O.AbuReesh - CV.pdf, chunk_id=4; chunk_id=3).
If you want, I can rank this candidate against others in the set or highlight any gaps that would need clarification from the candidate.

Q:Give a ranked shortlist for a full-stack developer, then explain why the others were not selected.

A: Ranked shortlist (best matches for a full‑stack developer)

Ibrahim Khdair
Why: explicit MERN/full‑stack projects (9gag meme sharing platform — user authentication, uploads, responsive UI) and backend projects built with Node.js/Express/MongoDB; technical skills list includes Node.js, React, Express, MongoDB. (Ibrahim khdairCV(SW).pdf, chunk_id=1; Ibrahim khdairCV(SW).pdf, chunk_id=4; Ibrahim khdairCV .docx.pdf, chunk_id=2)
Gaith (Gaith Resume Template 2026)
Why: internship experience developing/maintaining backend services and web front‑ends using React and Next.js; concrete full‑stack project (bus reservation app) using React + MongoDB. (Gaith Resume Template 2026.pdf, chunk_id=4; Gaith Resume Template 2026.pdf, chunk_id=3; Gaith Resume Template 2026.pdf, chunk_id=6)
Toqa Asedah
Why: lists MERN stack and related technologies and describes contributing to a full‑stack MERN web application (focused on front‑end) plus building/integrating back‑end APIs with FastAPI and responsive front‑ends in React. (ToqaAsedahCV.pdf, chunk_id=3; ToqaAsedahCV.pdf, chunk_id=2)
Why the others were not selected for the top 3 (brief)

Adham Yaqoub — Has relevant web/full‑stack skills (HTML/CSS, React, Node.js) and self‑identifies as a "full stack javascript developer" and notes developing full‑stack apps with Angular and Node.js, but compared to the top 3 there is less project/internship evidence of end‑to‑end MERN/Next.js experience in the provided snippets. (Adham Yaqoub - CV.docx.pdf, chunk_id=4; Adham Yaqoub - CV.docx.pdf, chunk_id=5)

O. AbuReesh — Has Node.js and React skills and a multifunctional e‑commerce project with user authentication (Storify) and talent management work, but most listed experience in the excerpts is data‑science/data‑entry internships rather than multiple full‑stack web projects. (O.AbuReesh - CV.pdf, chunk_id=4; O.AbuReesh - CV.pdf, chunk_id=3; O.AbuReesh - CV.pdf, chunk_id=6)

Emad Daraghmeh — Built full web systems (Blazor WebAssembly, ASP.NET Core, C#) and backend services and also worked on a mobile app architecture; good full‑stack evidence but uses primarily C#/Blazor stack rather than the JavaScript/Node/React stacks emphasized in the top choices. (Emad Daraghmeh CV.docx.pdf, chunk_id=1; Emad Daraghmeh CV.docx.pdf, chunk_id=2)

Mohammad Sayeh — Strong backend focus (Java EE, servlets, Struts, ASP.NET Core) with frontend described as "basic" JavaScript; more backend‑oriented in the provided excerpts. (Mohammad Sayeh resume.pdf, chunk_id=1; Mohammad Sayeh resume.pdf, chunk_id=2)

cv_training.pdf (unnamed candidate) — Lists frontend/JavaScript and backend/DB familiarity (FastAPI, MongoDB) and projects in machine learning, but the provided excerpt is less specific about full‑stack web projects or internships compared with the top candidates. (cv_training.pdf, chunk_id=2)

If you want, I can:

expand the shortlist to top 5 and reorder based on a preferred stack (e.g., Node/React vs .NET), or
produce tailored interview questions for the top 3 focused on their demonstrated stacks.
